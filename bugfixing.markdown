Like all Software has bugs. Given the constraints of Free Software and the involvement of volunteers it is not always possible to fix bugs before the release of the software.

For various reasons it can happen that important bugs for users do not get fixed. Given the fact that the software component may be programmed by volunteers there is no possibility for the users to get the bug fixed even if they are willing to pay for fixing the bug.

For such bugs I want to help. I offer the service to fix bugs on a professional scale. If you have a bug which you want to get fixed, get in touch with me. I will evaluate the time it will take me to fix the bug and provide you an offer. The only requirement on my side is that the bug can be reproduced.

Feel free to notify me about important bugs via christian [dot] gmeiner [at] gmail [dot] com. I will have a look at it and provide you an offer.
