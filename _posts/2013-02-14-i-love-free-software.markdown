Today is February 14. Some think of it as flower grocer appreciation day, but most (and for better reasons) celebrate it as the international [I ♥ Free Software day](http://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/2013/ilovefs.en.html).

Free and open source software makes it possible to fix problems and/or implement new features in software I use. I could write a lot of text why I think it is a good idea to support the open source community but I want you to form an opinion about this topic buy simply using open source software and support it. It does not mean you need to send in some patches… it starts with simple things like bug reports or user support.
