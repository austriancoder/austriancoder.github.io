The last two days I found again some time to hack on the em8300/dxr3 driver. I see the end comming of all my work, but I need to change the way I work. I have renamed the old project on github to v4l2-em8300-old and created a new one. Yes you have heard it correctly – a new one. I think that I have enough knowledge to start from scratch.

The new repository can be found here: [https://github.com/austriancoder/v4l2-em8300](https://github.com/austriancoder/v4l2-em8300)
