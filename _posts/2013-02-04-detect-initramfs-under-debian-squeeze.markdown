title: Detect initramfs under Debian squeeze

I am looking for a way to detect If a initramfs was used during boot. And after some reboots
 and reading of init script of initramfs-tools I found this solution.

 #!/bin/bash if [ -e /dev/.initramfs ]; then echo YES else echo NO fi

This may not work under wheezy or any other working distribution. But thatâ€™s okay for now ðŸ™‚
