It has been a long time since I did the last post and I want to bring you up to date regarding my personal blog. As you might have seen I have changed the used theme to better support mobile devices.

If your browser supports [NSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) you should access my blog via https now. It took me some time to setup everything but my new hoster [ueberspace](http://www.uberspace.de) made it a breeze to setup everything – thanks.

The biggest time safer for me is the switch to disqus comment system as it is quite time consuming to manage all the comments in the spam queue.

I hope you enjoy the new site and in the next blog I will talk about the current state of my biggest hobby project – etnaviv
