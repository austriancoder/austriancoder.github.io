Lets image you are working on a coreboot port for some mainboard and you are a very glad guy cause you have a jtag interface or something similar and you notice a hang, which could be caused by a never ending loop or some other mysterious stuff â€“ all you know is the current instruction pointer.

 objdump -S ./build/cbfs/fallback/coreboot_ram.elf

and search for the address of the instruction pointer â€“ may it help you to figure out whats
 going on ðŸ™‚
