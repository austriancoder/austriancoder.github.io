On my work linux machine I am using Ubuntu with KDE. As the new 4.11 was released I thought it would be a good idea to update my current KDE installation. As a long-term Gentoo user it needed some more steps.

 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

I think it is really time to replace my Ubuntu installation with something different/better.
