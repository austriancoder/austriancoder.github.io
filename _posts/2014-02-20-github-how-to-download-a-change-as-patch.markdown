Sometimes I can be useful to download a changes contained in a Github pull request as a unified diff. It turns out to be very easy.  To view a commit as a diff/patch file, just add `.diff` or `.patch` to the end of the URL

[For instance](https://github.com/austriancoder/etna_viv/commit/568d290514b6e61428bb73281ac596b0404c8f70.patch) [
](https://github.com/austriancoder/etna_viv/commit/568d290514b6e61428bb73281ac596b0404c8f70.patch)
