I think all of us run into this problem… the free space on a storage medium is getting smaller and smaller and you are not really sure why this is the case. For such cases I use a graphical tool to see the biggest space waster – as I am QT guy I am using [filelight](http://methylblue.com/filelight/ "filelight").
